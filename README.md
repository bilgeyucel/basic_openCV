# Video Processor with OpenCV
This is an alternative video processor that I implemented using different openCV features

Features I used:

* Greyscaling
* Gaussian Filter
* Bilateral Filter
* Object Detection
* Morphological Operations
    * Closing
    * Erosion
    * Opening
    * Dilation
* Sobel Filter
* Hough Circles
* Template Matching

### Usage

1. Change `"input.mp4"` and `"output.mp4"` names in `main.py` according to your file names
2. Run `main.py` :rocket:
3. Enjoy your video being processed and saved :film_projector:
